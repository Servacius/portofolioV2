    "summary": "Hey, I’m Joko Liber Servacius Banjarnahor (yes, my name is longer than most Java methods), a Software Engineer from Indonesia who loves turning caffeine into code. My journey into tech started back in 2008 when I discovered the magical world of custom AIMP3 themes and spent way too much time playing Alien Shooter on my school’s computer (sorry, teachers, I was “researching” game mechanics). Turns out, hacking themes and blasting aliens make me more curious about computers than I ever expected—who knew? When I’m not saving the world one line of code at a time, I working on my little and funny project, slay virtual dragons in video games, dive into books (mostly to figure out why my code doesn’t work and try to figure out live), and occasionally channel my inner Picasso to create digital art.",
